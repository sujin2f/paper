## Proof(2): Multi-Electron Atoms

So far, I tried to prove the hypothesis from Bohr model. However, the Bohr model is not accurate any more. In a quantum physics, an electron creates orbital shape in a result of absorbing energy. The ether is not a radial shape any more.

<p align="center"><strong>Atomic Orbital</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital">From : Wikipedia</a></p>

The shape of orbital is determined by quantum numbers n, l, and m<sub>l</sub>. The electron's energy, n, increases the number of node. The angular momentum, l, changes the shape of the node to linier. Let me ignore the magnetic quantum number, m<sub>l</sub>, which changes the angle of the orbital.

The s orbital is orbitals which only have a radial nodes. When there's no node, it is s1, and s2 has one radial node. The p orbital has one linear node. One linear node is p2, and one linear and one radial nodes is p3. Under this rule, scientists named d, f, and g orbital based on how many linear node the orbital has.

<p align="center"><strong>The Orbital with the Hypothesis</strong><br>The combination of radial and linear ethers</p>

We can translate node into the ether. Increasing n increases the number of ether, and increasing l changes the shape of the ether. The s orbital only has radial ethers, and the p orbital has one linear ether. The s1 orbital means the electron doesn't have any ether, and p3 orbital has one radial and one linear ethers.

The orbital has been understood to change the shape of an electron. Under my hypothesis, the electron is not changed, but its space is separated by the photon-ether likewise it is separated by the double-slit. If so, the electron-sparkle travels through the separated electron-ether, which is divided by the photon-ether, and the existence of the electron-sparkle exists in probability. This is what orbital is.

To be clear, I want to suggest the notation. The p3 is [-O], and [--O] is d4. Too many ether like [--OOOOO] can be written in [2-5O] for your readability. The data below is from [NIST](https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html). The configuration is from the same set which just changed l value (1S/J=0, 1P/J=1, 1D/J=2...)


### Hydrogen: Singular Electron

The hydrogen shows the exact, calculable values. The reason I mention the hydrogen is to check the accuracy of NIST data and to reveal what should be focused in other atoms.

<p align="center"><strong>Hydrogen Atom</strong><br>Simple as Classic Physics</p>

In each row set, the first value is a total EC, and the diff means the difference from the previous value. %p is difference when N<sub>th</sub>(n) value is 100%. NIST data is from various observation, and the values are same, so it is extremely accurate.

The first row set **s orbital** is what we should focus. This set shows **increment of radial ether**. The **diagonal set of top left to bottom right** is also important. The first diagonal set is **increment of linear ether**. From the second set, they represent the **similar set of increment of radial ether**. For example, p4 is [-O] to [-OO], and p5 is [--O] to [--OO]. The radial ethers are increased from one to two. **The diagonal sets should have at least similar tendency to the s orbital**, the first focusing set.

I will remove diff row and decrease the number of digits for your readability. A complete data is in [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h2QDhSlGnuXcMU1NcTvEcK2VkTSHqCUGpOti0S6YP5c/edit?usp=sharing).

### Helium: Multi-Electron Atom (two electrons)

The energy of multi-electron atom is not constant like hydrogen atom. Scientists say this is because of the influence of other electron(s). Nevertheless, to prove ether-sparkle hypothesis, it should have a tendency even though it is not a simple as N<sub>th</sub>(n). Let me check the helium, which shows the variety orbital. And its result is **very disappointing**.

<p align="center"><strong>Helium Atom</strong><br>Too irregular & huge failure</p>

The first positions of s, p, and linear orbital are high EC of approximate 100%p. The second position of linear change is irregular. The d and f orbitals are higher than N<sub>th</sub>(n), and others are lower. By increasing the number, it tends to close to N<sub>th</sub>(n), but the diagonal changes are not matched to each other. Moreover, it is not convincing why the changes of two and three linear ether, d and f, are different with other changes. The table is too irregular. There's no tendency. End of the story. Bye.

What if it is wrong that the way we think?

Let me recheck 3p orbital. It should be different between [O-] and [-O] because the radial and linear ether affect differently in different positions. [-] is 107.933, and [O] is 102.031, so [-O] should not be the same with [O-]. However, the 3p value from NIST is always same. Therefore, only one case is right.

When I constructed the table, I accepted s and p orbital which is linear ether first. What if it is opposite? What if the radial ether first, and then the linear ether comes above the radial ether?

<p align="center"><strong>Radial Ether First!!</strong></p>

See, human? See this beautiful tendency! Let me focus the change of the linear ethers. The first position is high, +107%p. The second position is -1.78, and from the third position they decrease to N<sub>th</sub>. Remember the hydrogen is about -0.05. This tendency can be found in every rows, which means the diagonal sets also have tendency.

Let me change the condition little bit along with this result. (1) the tendency of s orbital should exist (2) the tendency of linear ether and diagonal sets should be matched.

My excitement makes me drawing the diagonal table for you.

The first linear ether has high EC vale, the second is minus, and from the third, it converges to N<sub>th</sub>(n). It seems to be possible to make functions, and the overall EC would be calculated.

On the other hand, it has a rule, and I can say the condition of ether-sparkle hypothesis is compromised.

It explains how the radial ether increased and how the linear ether added above the radial ether. The orbital is not electron shape. The node is photon-ether, and the orbital is electron ether, divided by the photon-ether.

The table above is percent point. The EC of the position is the table below. Now I changed the digit from 1 because we do not need s1 which means no ether.
