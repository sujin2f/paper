## Proof(2): Multi-Electron Atoms

So far, I tried to prove the hypothesis from the Bohr model. However, the Bohr model is not accurate anymore. In quantum physics, an electron creates an orbital shape as a result of absorbing energy. The ether is not a radial shape anymore.

<p align="center"><strong>Atomic Orbital</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital">From : Wikipedia</a></p>

The shape of the orbital is determined by quantum numbers n, l, and m<sub>l</sub>. The electron's energy, n, increases the number of the node. The angular momentum, l, changes the shape of the node to linear. Let me ignore the magnetic quantum number, m<sub>l</sub>, which changes the angle of the orbital.

The s orbital is an orbital that only has radial nodes. When there's no node, it is s1, and s2 has one radial node. The p orbital has one linear node. One linear node is p2, and one linear and one radial node is p3. Under this rule, scientists named d, f, and g orbital based on how many linear nodes the orbital has.

<p align="center"><strong>The Orbital with the Hypothesis</strong><br>The combination of radial and linear ethers</p>

We can translate the node into the ether. Increasing n increases the number of ethers, and increasing l changes the shape of the ether. The s orbital only has radial ethers, and the p orbital has one linear ether. The s1 orbital means the electron doesn't have any ether, and p3 orbital has one radial and one linear ether.

The orbital has been understood to change the shape of an electron. Under my hypothesis, the electron is not changed, but its space is separated by the photon-ether likewise it is separated by the double-slit. If so, the electron-sparkle travels through the separated electron-ether, which is divided by the photon-ether, and the existence of the electron-sparkle exists in probability. This is what orbital is.

To be clear, I want to suggest the notation. The p3 is [-O], and [--O] is d4. Too many ethers like [--OOOOO] can be written in [2-5O] for your readability. The data below is from [NIST](https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html). The configuration is from the same set which just changed l value (1S/J=0, 1P/J=1, 1D/J=2...) I built the website to visualize the data [here](https://ether.sujinc.com/orbital/1+1/graph/percent). The correction value is what the formula satisfied.

$$Diff = (\frac{1}{n+c})^2 - (\frac{1}{n+1+c})^2$$

### Hydrogen: Singular Electron

The hydrogen shows the exact, calculable values. The reason I mention the hydrogen is to check the accuracy of NIST data and to reveal what should be focused on in other atoms.

NIST data is from various observations, and the values are the same, so it is extremely accurate. As we already know, the value meets N<sub>th</sub>(n), but we still can see the small differences.

The first-row set **s orbital** is what we should focus on. This set shows **an increment of radial ether**. The **diagonal set of top left to bottom right from p** is also important. The first diagonal set is **the increment of linear ether**. From the second set, they represent a **similar set of increments of radial ether**. For example, p4 is [-O] to [-OO], and p5 is [--O] to [--OO]. So, every orbital should have the same tendency because it's all about radial ether increment. In the other words, **the diagonal sets and linear; and s orbital and the other orbitals should have a similar tendency** because they are the same increments.

Let's go back to the graph. The s orbital goes up and keeps down. Linear ether comes from top-left to bottom-right as the y=a/x graph goes. Other orbitals, well..., not quite organized, and also not quite matched to the s orbital changes. This is a pretty graph, but I can't say it's satisfactory.

### Helium: Multi-Electron Atom (two electrons)

The energy of the multi-electron atom is not constant like a hydrogen atom. Scientists say this is because of the influence of other electrons. Nevertheless, to prove the ether-sparkle hypothesis, it should have a tendency even though it is not as simple as N<sub>th</sub>(n). Let me check the helium, which shows the variety of orbital. And its result is **very disappointing**.

<p align="center"><strong>Helium Atom</strong><br>Too irregular & huge failure</p>

The first positions of s, p, and linear orbital are high Rydberg of approximately 100%p. The d and f orbitals are higher than N<sub>th</sub>(n), and others are lower. By increasing the position, it tends to close to N<sub>th</sub>(n), but the diagonal changes are not matched to each other. Moreover, it is not convincing why the changes of two and three linear ether, d and f, are different from other changes. The table is too irregular. There's no tendency. End of the story. Bye.

What if the way we think is wrong?

Let me recheck the 3p orbital. It should be different between [O-] and [-O] because the radial and linear ether affect differently in different positions. [-] is 107.933, and [O] is 102.031, so [-O] should not be the same as [O-]. However, the 3p value from NIST is always the same. Therefore, only one case is right.

When I constructed the table, I accepted the s and p orbital which is linear ether first. What if it is the opposite? What if the radial ether first, and then the linear ether comes above the radial ether?

<p align="center"><strong>Radial Ether First!!</strong></p>

See, human? See this beautiful tendency! Each row shows the increment of linear ethers. So, we need to compare other rows with linear ether. They go down and close to the N<sub>th</sub>(n).

My excitement makes me draw the diagonal table for you.

The first linear ether has a high Rydberg vale, the second is minus, and from the third, it converges to N<sub>th</sub>(n). It seems to be possible to make functions, and the overall Rydberg would be calculated.

On the other hand, it has a rule, and I can say the condition of the ether-sparkle hypothesis is compromised.

It explains how the radial ether increased and how the linear ether was added above the radial ether. The orbital is not an electron shape. The node is photon-ether, and the orbital is electron ether, divided by the photon-ether.

The table above is the percentage point. The Rydberg of the position is in the table below. Now I changed the digit from 1 because we do not need s1 which means no ether.

This tendency can be observed in other atoms like lithium, beryllium, boron, and neon. It is also on the same site as [Neon](https://ether.sujinc.com/ether/10+1/graph/percent). I am sure I can find a beautiful equation to get values, but I make it the next research.
