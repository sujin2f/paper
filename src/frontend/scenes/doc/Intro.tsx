                A matter is a composition of mass and electromagnetic, a photon
                is mass-independent electromagnetic, and mass is an
                electromagnetic-independent matter.

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                This document introduces a new hypothesis about the structure of
                a matter. According to this hypothesis, the matter can be
                divided into the ether, which is the space of mass, and the
                sparkle, the electromagnetic-like object. And ether and a
                sparkle even can be swapped as a different form of energy. A
                particle, like an electron, is a compound of ether and a
                sparkle, and a photon is an independent sparkle. I call this
                hypothesis the ether-sparkle theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                To prove it, I will try to reveal what the independent ether is,
                which is a space with mass. In the classic physics, energy from
                a hydrogen-like atom is concrete. It is a simple equation. What
                if it would seem to be able to calculate in multi-electron atom
                along with my theory? This document will follow the step to open
                the possibilities.
