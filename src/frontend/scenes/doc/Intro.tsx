            Hypothesis on the Spatiality and Temporality of Matter

            A Matter as a Composite of Mass-Electromagnetic Waves, Photons as

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            This document aims to propose a new hypothesis regarding the
            structure of matter. According to this hypothesis, matter can be
            divided into two entities: the ether, which constitutes the
            spatiality of mass, and sparkles, which possess the properties of
            electromagnetic waves. These two entities can interact with each
            other. If particles such as electrons are considered as composites
            of ether and sparkles, photons can be seen as sparkles without
            ether. Let's refer to this hypothesis as the Ether-Sparkle
            Hypothesis.
        </p>
        <p>
            To demonstrate this, this document will explore the existence of
            independent ether. In order to do so, we will reinterpret the Bohr
            model and orbitals. If we can provide a simpler explanation for
            phenomena observed in matter from the perspective of the
            Ether-Sparkle framework, it may present a small possibility in
            support of the hypothesis.
