                of an electron along with the hypothesis. This famous experiment
                shows the wave-particle duality well. The electron passes two
                slits at the same time, but it appears at one slit by the
                observation. After all, it produces a wave pattern.

            <p>
                With my hypothesis, the probability cloud is a part of an
                electron. We can assume the space of an electron is separated by
                the double-slit. Now, the space of an electron becomes two
                spaces, but the particle can go around through the spaces. The
                wave pattern means both spaces have a particle.
            </p>
            <p>
                If so, the space of an electron is not the same as the space we
                know. It is a new space that can be divided but also connected
                to each other. I name this space <strong>ether</strong>, and
                what we have thought as a particle is a <strong>sparkle</strong>
                . Now, the hypothesis becomes the hypothesis that the matter is
                a compound of ether and a sparkle.
            </p>

            <div className="align__center">

                <p>
                    <strong>Name it!</strong>: ether and a sparkle
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                So, what are the nature of ether and a sparkle? Let me analogize
                with a photon and an electron. The two matters have similar
                characteristics -- both a particle and wave, but they are
                different in mass and speed. The weight of the photon is zero,
                and it has the speed of light in a vacuum. In contrast, the
                electron has weight and does not move like the photon.
            </p>

            <p>
                The hypothesis explains that the electron has a space, and the
                sparkle is bonded to the space. Therefore, I guess the photon is
                a standalone sparkle that does not have any ether. Following
                this idea, I can assume the ether has a mass, and the sparkle is
                a photon or similar material. The space of a photon-sparkle is a
                universe, and its speed is consistent. Yet, the universe of the
                electron-sparkle is electron-ether, so the sparkle is bonded to
                the mass. Thus, it has a lower speed. The nature of the photon
                and electron is from the space of each sparkle.

            <p>
                Another difference between the ether and a sparkle would be
                observability. Science has observed the sparkle only. Assuming
                the existence of the ether, the ether has a mass but does not
                have observability.

            <h3>Standalone Ether, The Photon-Ether: from the Bohr model</h3>

            <p>
                I have assumed the matter is the ether-sparkle compound and the
                photon is a standalone sparkle. It is natural to have a question
                about the existence of standalone ether: the thing which is not
                observable and has a mass.
            </p>

            <p>Let me reanalyze the Bohr model to guess what it is.</p>

            <div className="align__center">

            </div>

            <p>
                According to the Bohr model, an atom absorbs a certain amount of
                energy with an increment in its orbit by integer n, and
                releasing energy acts the opposite way. What if I changed this
                model to a mass goes in between the orbits? Let me reconstruct
                this model to the standalone sparkle turns into the standalone
                ether and goes between the orbit.

                    alt="Reconstruction Bohr Model by Ether-Sparkle Hypothesis"

            <p>
                A photon-sparkle morphs into the photon-ether along with its
                energy and is placed into the orbit, so the position of the
                electron would be increased. On the other hand, when the ether
                turns into a sparkle, the position of the electron decreased.
                When the atom absorbs the photon, the photon becomes a mass and
                is placed into the electron cloud.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the next chapter, I explore the nature of photon-ether to
                prove my hypothesis. It would be a small proof if the
                photon-ether has a certain characteristic.
