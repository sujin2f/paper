        <h2 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>
            This document begins with a single question. According to quantum
            physics, matter exists as a probability. However, is the probability
            space truly empty and devoid of meaning? What if that space is
            actually a part of matter? What implications would that have?
        </p>
        <div className="align__center">

                <strong>Hypothesis</strong>
                <br />
                The probability cloud would be a part of the particle
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            In dividing matter into space and particles, what characteristics do
            space and particles possess? It has been revealed that photons
            exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties. Similarly,
            electrons have been shown to possess both particle and wave
            characteristics. This laid the foundation for the birth of quantum
            physics. If we consider the particles in the left model, which we
            previously understood as matter, as something with both particle and
            wave properties, we can assume that space symbolizes something else.
            In that case, the dots in the hypothesis on the right would
            represent something similar or identical to photons. The probability
            space could be seen as a world akin to that of photon-ish matter,
            bound within it.
        </p>

        <h3>Ether and Sparkle</h3>

        <p>
            If that's the case, what is the probability space? Assuming that the
            mass of a photon-ish matter is also zero, just like the photon with
            zero mass, we can assume that what has mass is space. A photon in a
            vacuum state travels at the speed of light. On the other hand,
            photon-ish matter bound by mass would have a slower speed. If the
            mass of space increases, the speed of photon-ish matter would
            decrease, and vice versa. The universe is what photons can travel
            through. If the space of a photon is the entire universe, then the
            universe of photon-ish matter can be considered a probability space
            with mass.

            Let's pause for a moment. Instead of 'photon-ish matter' and
            'probability space of mass,' let's give them different names. We'll
            call the probability space 'Ether,' and the photon-ish matter will
            be referred to as 'Sparkle.' I acknowledge that using the term
            'Ether,' an obsolete concept, may lead to misunderstandings, but
            that's my choice. I can't find a more fitting word than this
        </p>

        <div className="align__center">

                <strong>Name it!</strong>: ether and a sparkle
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            So, what happens when Sparkle reaches the boundary within Ether?
            There's no answer to that question, but for the hypothesis to hold,
            it must be impossible to escape beyond Ether. The structure of Ether
            could be considered as a space that has no end, whether it's a
            three-dimensional MÃ¶bius strip or a more complex structure
        </p>

        <p>
            The universe is said to be expanding, where space is stretching.
            Let's look at the diagram below. The speed of light is always
            constant. I believe this is the absolute unit we can consistently
            measure in the universe. Speed is the ratio of distance to time. In
            other words, using the speed of light, we can posit absolute
            distance and absolute time. With absolute distance, we can shift our
            perspective to see that space in the universe is not expanding but
            rather emerging.

        <p>
            Now, let's rewind time and go back to the early moments of the Big
            Bang. Let's rewind time until the point where the size of the
            universe is an absolute distance. In this scenario, where does the
            light go? If it disappears, the first law of thermodynamics is
            violated. I believe that this light will return to the universe
            through some spatial structure.

        <p>The structure of Ether would likely be similar.</p>

            for electrons based on the hypothesis. This famous experiment
            illustrates the duality of waves and particles. Electrons pass
            through both slits simultaneously, but upon observation, they appear
            to exist at only one of the slits. Ultimately, this results in the
            formation of diffraction patterns.

                The space can be divided
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            If we reinterpret this according to the hypothesis, we can assume
            that Ether has been separated by the two slits. The space called
            Ether has split into two in the three-dimensional coordinate system
            that we refer to as space, but Sparkle can freely move between these
            two spaces. They are still the same space, the same Ether. The
            appearance of diffraction patterns signifies that both split Ethers
            each contain one Sparkle. This implies that Ether is something other
            than the space as we know it in the coordinate system. It can be
            separated but still remains a connected space.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another characteristic of Ether and Sparkle would be their
            observability. Science has observed only Sparkle until now. Assuming
            the existence of Ether, it would have{' '}
            <strong>mass but remain unobservable</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>Sparkle-Independent Ether</h3>

        <p>
            From the assumptions made so far, we can derive the properties of
            photons. Since the mass of a photon is zero, we can say that a
            photon is a Sparkle not bound by Ether. In other words, the Ether of
            a photon would be the entire universe. We assumed the existence of
            matter as a composite of Ether and Sparkle, and a photon as a
            Sparkle independent of Ether. Then, we may wonder if there could be
            Sparkle-independent Ether, the opposite concept of a photon. It is
            unobservable but a material with mass. Can such a thing really
            exist?
        </p>

        <p>
            To speculate on what Sparkle-independent Ether might be, let's
            examine Niels Bohr's atomic model."
        </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Classic Physics</strong>: Bohr Model
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            In Bohr's atomic model, when an electron absorbs photons (energy) of
            a specific wavelength, the orbit of the electron increases by an
            integer denoted as 'n,' and when it emits photons of that
            wavelength, the orbit decreases. The orbits of electrons making up
            an atom do not gradually increase when absorbing energy. Instead,
            they abruptly change, like the transition between numbers in a
            digital clock rather than the smooth movement of an analog clock.
            When the electron transitions from orbit 1 to orbit 2, it doesn't go
            through increments like 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4...; it just becomes 2.
            This abrupt change with a discrete nature, possessing the property
            of quantity, is called a quantum, and it gave rise to quantum
            mechanics.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's reconsider this model by imagining that Sparkle-independent
            photons transform into Ether-independent Sparkles with mass,
            entering the space between orbits. Think of the energy of light
            entering the atom as being transformed into Ether where Sparkles do
            not exist.

        <p>
            The Sparkle known as a photon is converted into Ether, or mass
            equivalent to its corresponding energy, and positions itself between
            the electron and the atomic nucleus. Consequently, the orbit of the
            electron increases. Conversely, when releasing energy, Ether
            transforms back into Sparkle, exiting in the form of a photon, and
            the electron's orbit decreases. When an atom absorbs a photon, it
            means that the mass equivalent to the energy of the photon is
            restored as unobservable Ether between the electron cloud, abruptly!
            This explains why the electron's orbit doesn't gradually increase or
            decrease. Let's name this substance determining the electron's
            orbit, which was a Sparkle and has now transformed into Ether,
            'photon-Ether.'
        </p>

        <p>
            Photon-Ether is Ether without Sparkle, having mass but being
            unobservable. Is this possible? In the following chapters, we will
            explore the existence of photon-Ether and attempt to provide
            evidence. If the photon-Ether absorbed by the electron exhibits
            regular properties, it could serve as proof for its existence.
