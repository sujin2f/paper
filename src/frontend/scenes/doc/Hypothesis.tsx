        <h2 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>
            This document begins with a single question. According to quantum
            physics, matter exists as a probability. However, is the probability
            space truly empty and devoid of meaning? What if that space is
            actually a part of matter? What implications would that have?
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            Matter was divided into space and particles. So, what
            characteristics do each of them possess? Let's go back to the early
            days of quantum physics. Just like photons, matter was found to
            exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties, which formed
            the foundation of quantum physics. Therefore, we can assume that the
            particles in the above diagram, representing matter as we know it,
            possess the properties of conventional matter, while space
            symbolizes something else.
        </p>

        <p>
            What if the particles in the above diagram were similar to or
            closely resembled photons? If matter is composed of both space and
            confined photon-like matter, then we can consider the spatial extent
            of actual photons to be the entire universe. Just as photons have
            zero mass, if the photon-like matter also have zero mass, we can
            assume that mass belongs to space. A photon in a vacuum travels at
            the speed of light. On the other hand, a photon-like matter confined
            by mass would have a slower speed. If the density of space
            increases, the speed of photon-like matter would decrease, and the
            reverse would hold true as well.

        <h3>Ether and Sparkle</h3>

        <p>
            At this point, I feel the need for their names. Let's call the space
            of matter "Ether" and the photon-like matter within it "Sparkles." I
            understand that using the term "Ether," which is a defunct concept,
            may lead to misunderstandings. However, I cannot find a more
            suitable word than this.
        </p>

            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Where is time?</h3>

        <p>
            According to the theory of relativity, the velocity of matter
            affects its mass. If we consider this as an increase in the density
            of Ether, the velocity of Sparkles can also be seen as symbolic of
            time. The magnitude of time would be proportional to the velocity of
            Sparkles within matter.
        </p>

        <p>
            So far, our inference has brought about a change in the position of
            time. We used to think that time exists throughout the universe. The
            universe was considered as spacetime. However, according to the flow
            of this line of thought, time becomes a property of matter. Matter
            is spacetime.
        </p>

        <p>
            If time does not exist in the universe, what changes would occur?
            With my limited knowledge, nothing would happen. Let's assume a
            universe with only one star. This star is moving at a constant
            velocity. The matter that makes up the star has its own time, which
            would be synchronized because they are moving at the same velocity.
            Here, velocity is a constant and not a relative concept. Relative
            velocity arises only when an observer exists. Now, let's consider an
            observer. Velocity, mass, and time become relative concepts. They
            are relative because both the star and an observer has its own
            attributes.
        </p>

        <h3>Gravity and Time</h3>
        <p>
            If time is a property of matter, then it would be energy. If the
            velocity increases, the mass increases, and conversely, the time
            decreases. In other words, the forces of gravity and time vary
            oppositely based on the velocity. This is similar to the
            relationship between electricity and magnetism. If electricity is
            magnetism and magnetism is electricity, then gravity and time can be
            seen to share the same essence. This is because the increase in mass
            affects the velocity of Sparkles.

            for electrons based on the hypothesis. This renowned experiment
            vividly demonstrates the wave-particle duality of matter. Electrons
            pass through two slits simultaneously, but when observed, they
            appear to exist only at one of the two slits. Ultimately, this
            phenomenon results in the formation of an interference pattern.

        </div>

        <p>
            In this experiment, it can be assumed that Ether is separated by the
            two slits. The Ether is divided into two, while Sparkles can freely
            move between the two spaces. The appearance of an interference
            pattern implies that both spaces. Therefore, Ether is something
            other than the space we know as a coordinate system. It is a new
            space that can be separated but still connected.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another characteristic of Ether and Sparkles would be their
            observability. Science has only observed Sparkles so far. Assuming
            the existence of Ether, Ether would possess mass but become
            unobservable.
        </p>

        <h3>Sparkle-Independent Ether: In Bohr's Atomic Model</h3>

        <p>
            We have assumed the existence of matter as a composite of Ether and
            Sparkles, and the Ether-independent Sparkle, which is the photon.
            The Ether of the photon encompasses the entire universe. In light of
            this, we question whether there could be a Sparkle-independent
            Ether, which is the opposite concept of the photon. It is an
            unobservable substance with mass.
        </p>

        <p>
            To deduce what Sparkle-independent Ether could be, let us examine
            Niels Bohr's atomic model.
        </p>

                <strong>Classic Physics</strong>: Bohr Model
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            In Bohr's atomic model, when an electron absorbs a photon of a
            specific wavelength, its orbit increases by an integer value called
            "n." Conversely, when it emits a photon of that wavelength, the
            orbit decreases. Now, let us reconsider the framework of thought by
            envisioning that the Ether-independent Sparkle, which is the photon
            with mass, transforms into a Sparkle-independent Ether that enters
            between the orbits.

        </div>

        <p>
            The photon, known as the Sparkle, converts into Ether with an
            equivalent amount of energy, which is mass, and positions itself in
            the electron's orbit, causing the orbit to increase accordingly.
            Conversely, when energy is emitted, Ether transforms back into a
            Sparkle and exits in the form of a photon, resulting in a decrease
            in the electron's orbit. When an atom absorbs a photon, the energy
            of the photon is reduced to mass, becoming an unobservable Ether
            located between the electron clouds. This explanation accounts for
            the gradual increase in the electron's orbit and provides insight
            into the quantum nature of the phenomenon. Let's name this substance
            that forms the electron's orbit, which was once a Sparkle but has
            transformed into Ether, the Photon-Ether.
        </p>

        <p>
            From the next chapter onwards, we will attempt to explore the
            properties of the Photon-Ether in an effort to provide evidence by
            investigating the regular characteristics of the Photon-Ether that
            the electron absorbs.
