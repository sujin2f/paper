            <li>Rydberg is magnificent, sir.</li>

            <li>
                The energy levels of multi-electron atoms can be explained by
                the Rydberg formula through vertical and horizontal shifts.
                Therefore, Rydberg is magnificent, sir.
            </li>

            <li>
                Assuming that the nodes of the orbitals are photon-ether, there
                is a high possibility that there are rules (patterns) governing
                the energy at which photon-ether accumulate.
            </li>

            <li>
                Placing the orbits in order of circular ether reveals distinct
                patterns. Therefore, a reassessment of the orbital
                classification method based on the linear ether counts of s, p,
                d orbitals may be necessary.
            </li>

            <li>
                Further exploration of horizontal movements may lead to the
                creation of a new equation describing Hunt's rules.
            </li>

            <li>
                In summary, there is a possibility that the energy levels of
                electrons involve addition.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            It is challenging to determine whether what has been described so
            far provides sufficient evidence to prove the existence of ether.
            Although it may be premature to call the nodes of the orbitals as
            photon-ether, considering them as material with mass, I believe it
            is still too early. However, I am confident that we can more clearly
            explain the quantum nature of the energy levels of electrons with my
            explanation. This is because a spark of light transitioning into
            photon-ether in an instant is likely to possess the property of
            quantity. In this concluding section, under the assumption that this
            hypothesis is correct, I will organize other possibilities that can
            be considered later. Of course, the notion that this could be purely
            speculative is an underlying premise throughout this document.

        <h3>(1-1) Where is time?</h3>

        <p>
            According to the theory of relativity, the speed of matter affects
            its mass and time. If we consider the increase in mass as an
            increase in the density of ether, then the spark within it will
            naturally slow down. The slowing down of the speed of particles that
            make up us could imply that time is flowing slowly for us. Could the
            perceived time be related to the speed of the sparks that make us
            up?
        </p>

        <p>
            The assumption above illustrates the position of time. The universe
            is spacetime. However, according to the assumption, time becomes a
            property of matter. Each piece of matter becomes an entity with its
            own time. The universe is an empty space without time, and matter
            becomes spacetime.
        </p>

        <p>
            If time does not exist in the universe, what changes might occur?
            With my limited knowledge, nothing would happen. Let's assume a
            universe with only one planet. This planet is moving at a constant
            velocity. The particles that make up the planet each have their own
            time, but their times would be the same because they are in the same
            inertial frame. From this perspective, the velocity is constant.
            It's not a relative concept. Relative velocity only arises when an
            observer is present. Now let's assume an observer. Velocity, mass,
            and time become relative concepts. "Oh, that planet is moving at n
            km/s relative to me. Time dilation is occurring relative to me on
            that planet. The relative mass of that planet is heavier than mine."
            These are observed based on the properties the observer has.
        </p>

        <p>Time is the speed of sparks and a property of matter.</p>

        <h3>(1-2) Time Dilation</h3>

        <p>
            If time is a property of matter, it is a force and energy. When the
            property of speed increases, the property of mass (gravity) also
            increases, and conversely, the property of time decreases. Thus, the
            forces of gravity and time change oppositely based on the property
            of velocity. This is similar to the relationship between electricity
            and magnetism. If electricity is essentially magnetism, and
            magnetism is essentially electricity, gravity and time might also
            share the same essence. The fact that light has a constant speed
            everywhere might be because it is not bound by ether. It's a free
            sparkle without ether.

                <strong>Time Dilation under Ether-Sparkle Perspective</strong>
                <br />
                Time is a property of matter, and it's changeable
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Applying this, we can explain time dilation more neatly. In
            different inertial systems, in different gravities, the speed of
            sparks changes, leading to a change in time. It's not that time
            exists in our universe, but each piece of matter has its own time.
            The time of the many pieces of matter that make us up would also
            flow differently. Time would flow differently within the same
            physical system, just as the mass difference between a proton and an
            electron. And this could be the reason why atomic clocks are
            precise. Matter possesses time.
        </p>

        <h3>(1-3) Absolute Time and Absolute Velocity</h3>

        <p>
            If time is a property of matter, another property that changes it is
            velocity. Then, what velocity and time do we possess? We orbit
            around the Sun, and the solar system revolves around our galaxy. Our
            galaxy? We exist in such an inertial system. In an inertial system
            with a smaller velocity, the sparks will move faster, and the
            magnitude of time will increase. So, could there be an inertial
            frame with absolute time somewhere? The slowest place in the
            universe, where time flows the fastest.

                <strong>Finding Absolute Time</strong>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Let's conduct a thought experiment. Place two measuring devices on
            an orbital path. Device 2 is stationary, and Device 1 is moving at
            twice the speed of Earth's orbit. From the perspective of Earth,
            both devices will be moving away relatively equally. Will their
            times be the same? If we launch measuring devices in the direction
            of the Sun's orbit around our galaxy, will their times be the same?
            This is easily predictable. They would, of course, be different.
        </p>

        <p>
            Expanding this further, if we launch measuring devices in various
            directions from Earth, we might be able to understand in which
            direction our galaxy is moving. Combining these, could we find
            absolute time? The answer would be yes if our galaxy moves in a
            specific direction, at a specific speed, reaching absolute time. Of
            course, this thought assumes that our galaxy is not influenced by
            external celestial bodies, and in reality, the influences of our
            galactic neighborhood could be significant.

        <h3>(2) Double-Tunnel Experiment</h3>

                <strong>Double-Tunnel Experiment</strong> Splitting ether, where
                is sparkle at?
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            One such experiment involves creating a double tunnel instead of a
            double slit. If we elongate the double slit to create a tunnel-like
            structure and confine electrons within it, what would happen? Ether
            divided into A and B sections would occupy each tunnel, and sparks
            would travel between the two ethers. Observing this, electrons in
            each tunnel would probabilistically exist, and when observed
            simultaneously, they would appear in only one tunnel. One ether
            could vanish, possibly being absorbed beyond space into the other
            ether. If not, the universe would overflow with split ethers, making
            it unstable.
        </p>

        <p>
            Surprisingly, this scenario has been experimentally validated. In
            the experiment, a neutron was passed through two channels, altering
            its spin in each. The spin change was observed to influence both
            sides.{' '}

                Sparks behave as if two ethers are one

        <p>
            According to the hypothesis, the electron-ether demonstrated
            division by the photon-ether. In the double-slit experiment, the
            electron-ether also splits into two. Sparks within the divided
            ethers freely traverse both sides. Even when one ether is separated
            in the coordinate space as we perceive it, it functions as the same
            ether. Quantum entanglement might arise from the properties of
            ethers, cautiously suggesting such an opinion.
