        <p>
            This document explains aggressive arguments, and there is a very
            small possibility that the hypothesis would be right.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the hypothesis is right, the particle is completely different
            than what we know before. Mass becomes the space that we knew as a
            probability cloud. The photon is a similar thing with a sparkle
            inside the ether. Energy absorbed into an atom preserves the form of
            the mass.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, what is the Photon-Ether, the independent ether, is
            invisible, and has weight. One possibility is dark matter.
            Otherwise, it would be a Higgs boson. Or it would be a Neutrino.
            Possibly, none of them.{' '}

        <h3>Suggesting an Experiment</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Double Tunnel Experiment</strong>: Where it suppose to
                go if it is divided into two pieces?
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            I imagine the experiment to prove the hypothesis, making a double
            tunnel instead of the double slit. What would happen inside the
            tunnel? Each tunnel contains the divided ethers, and the sparkle
            would travel through the spaces. I expect one ether should be
            disappeared. Otherwise, our world will be full of divided ether, and
            it is not stable.

            <strong>Added on 2022-11-15</strong> It happened. The experience is
            changing the spin of a divided neutron, and the neutron was affected
            by both tunnels.{' '}

            Hypothesis of the Hypothesis (1): Time does not exist in our
            universe.
        </h3>
        <p>
            What is a sparkle? Ether cannot travel more than the speed of light
            because the mass will be increased and become like a black hole, and
            the sparkle will be stopped eventually. Therefore, the independent
            sparkle, the light, can fly at the speed of light. In the other
            words, the sparkle has the property, named time. Time is not the
            property of our universe. It is the property of the matter.
            Logically speaking, there is no concrete reason the universe should
            have time.

                <strong>Time Dilation in Ether-Sparkle</strong>
                <br />
                Time is a property of sparkle, and it can be changed by its
                surrounding ether.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            In this way, the time dilation can be explained more clearly. In a
            different inertial frame, in different gravity, the speed of the
            sparkle will be changed, and it is related to its time. Time is not
            in our universe. We, the matter, have the time. Each sparkle might
            have a different time due to the ether's weight. This may be the
            reason that the atomic clock is so accurate. An atom has its own
            time. Time is the part of an atom.

            Hypothesis of the Hypothesis (2): Entanglement is divided ether?
        </h3>

                <br />
                Sparkle can travel into two ethers
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            According to the hypothesis, the electron-ether can be divided by
            the photon-ether. The electron-ether is also divided by the
            double-slit. The sparkle inside it travel the divided ether freely.
            One ether is divided from our dimension, but they are connected. I
            suggest carefully the entanglement comes from the feature of the
            ether.
        </p>
        <h3>Follow-Ups</h3>
        <p>
            In the multi-electron atom, the Rydberg tends to follow a certain
            formula. If I found the exact formula to find Rydberg of radial and
            linear, I would be able to calculate the overall value by adding.
