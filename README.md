## Abstract

This document introduces the new hypothesis about the structure of a matter. According to the hypothesis, a matter can be divided to an ether, the space that has a mass, and a sparkle, the electromagnetic-like object; and those two elements can be swapped. A particle like electron is a compound of ether and sparkle, and a photon is a independent sparkle. I call this hypothesis as a ether-sparkle theory.

To prove it, I will try to reveal the independent ether, which is a mass space. In class physics, an energy from an hydrogen-like atom is certain; it can be solved by a simple equation. What if it would seem to be able to calculate in multi-electron atoms along with my theory? This document will follow the step to open the possibilities.
