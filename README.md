## Abstract

This document introduces a new hypothesis about the structure of a matter. According to this hypothesis, the matter can be divided into the ether, which is the space of mass, and the sparkle, the electromagnetic-like object. And ether and a sparkle even can be swapped as a different form of energy. A particle, like an electron, is a compound of ether and a sparkle, and a photon is an independent sparkle. I call this hypothesis the ether-sparkle theory.

To prove it, I will try to reveal what the independent ether is, which is a space with mass. In the classic physics, energy from a hydrogen-like atom is concrete. It is a simple equation. What if it would seem to be able to calculate in multi-electron atom along with my theory? This document will follow the step to open the possibilities.
